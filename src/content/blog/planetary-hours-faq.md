# Planetary Hours FAQ: Expert Answers to Your Most Important Questions

As experts in the field of Planetary Hours, we've compiled and answered the 20 most pressing questions from our users. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced practitioner, this comprehensive Q&A guide will provide you with clear, accurate answers and practical insights.

## Fundamental Concepts

### 1. What are planetary hours in astrology?

**Quick Answer:** Planetary hours are an ancient timekeeping system that divides each day's 24 hours into segments ruled by the seven classical planets in rotation.

**Detailed Explanation:** Planetary hours originate from ancient astrology, particularly the Hellenistic astrological tradition. Unlike the familiar fixed 60-minute hours, planetary hours have variable lengths that depend on the sunrise and sunset times at your specific location. The system divides daylight (sunrise to sunset) into 12 equal segments, and nighttime (sunset to next sunrise) into another 12 equal segments. Each segment is ruled by one of the seven classical planets: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

**Practical Example:** In New York City, a daytime planetary hour on the winter solstice might be only 45 minutes long, while on the summer solstice it could extend to 75 minutes.

### 2. How do planetary hours work?

**Quick Answer:** Planetary hours work by assigning day and night time segments to the seven classical planets according to the Chaldean Order.

**Detailed Explanation:** The system follows specific rules: First, each day's initial planetary hour (at sunrise) is determined by that day's ruling planet (e.g., Sunday is ruled by the Sun). Subsequent hours are then assigned in cycles following the Chaldean Order: Saturn → Jupiter → Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon. This sequence is based on ancient observations of planetary orbital speeds, from the slowest (Saturn) to the fastest (Moon).

**Practical Example:** On Tuesday (Mars day), the first planetary hour is ruled by Mars, the second by the Sun, the third by Venus, and so forth through the cycle.

### 3. What is the Chaldean order of planets?

**Quick Answer:** The Chaldean Order is the ancient sequence of planets established by Chaldean astronomers: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon.

**Detailed Explanation:** This order is based on ancient astronomers' observations of planetary orbital periods, arranged from the slowest (Saturn at ~29 years) to the fastest (Moon at ~29 days). This sequence not only governs planetary hours but also influenced the naming of our modern weekdays. When you take every 24th hour ruler following this order, you get our familiar weekly sequence.

**Practical Example:** Starting with Sunday's Sun, taking every 24th hour in Chaldean Order gives us: Sun (Sunday) → Moon (Monday) → Mars (Tuesday) → Mercury (Wednesday) → Jupiter (Thursday) → Venus (Friday) → Saturn (Saturday).

### 4. How to calculate planetary hours?

**Quick Answer:** Calculating planetary hours requires accurate sunrise and sunset times, then dividing day and night into 12 equal segments each.

**Detailed Explanation:** Manual calculation steps: 1) Obtain precise sunrise and sunset times for your location; 2) Calculate daytime duration (sunset time - sunrise time) ÷ 12 = length of each daytime planetary hour; 3) Calculate nighttime duration (next day's sunrise - sunset) ÷ 12 = length of each nighttime planetary hour; 4) Assign planets based on the day's ruler and Chaldean Order.

**Practical Example:** If sunrise is 6:00 AM and sunset is 6:00 PM, each daytime planetary hour is exactly 1 hour. But in winter, if sunrise is 7:30 AM and sunset is 5:30 PM, each daytime planetary hour is only 50 minutes.
